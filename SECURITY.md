### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We aim to acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: We'll provide updates on our progress within 7 days
- **Resolution**: We'll work to release a fix as quickly as possible, depending on complexity

### Disclosure Policy

- Please give us reasonable time to fix the vulnerability before public disclosure
