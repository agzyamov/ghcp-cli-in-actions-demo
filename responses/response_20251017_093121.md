● In Python, `async` and `await` are keywords that work together for asynchronous programming, but
    serve different purposes:

   **`async`** declares that a function is a coroutine. When you define a function with `async
   def`, it becomes an asynchronous function that returns a coroutine object when called. It
   doesn't automatically run asynchronously—it just marks the function as capable of being paused
   and resumed.

   **`await`** is used inside async functions to pause execution until an awaitable object (like
   another coroutine, task, or future) completes. It yields control back to the event loop,
   allowing other tasks to run while waiting, then resumes execution with the result once the
   awaited operation finishes.

   Example:
   ```python
   async def fetch_data():  # async declares this as a coroutine
       data = await some_io_operation()  # await pauses here until complete
       return data
   ```

   Without `await`, calling an async function just returns a coroutine object without executing it.
    Without `async`, you can't use `await` inside a function.
