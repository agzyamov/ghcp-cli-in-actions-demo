## üìã Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- GitHub Copilot subscription
- For Q&A: Personal Access Token (PAT) with Copilot scope
- For Coding Agent: OAuth token with appropriate permissions

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### For Contributors: Try It Yourself

Want to experiment with this demo? Fork the repository:

1. Click the **Fork** button at the top of this page
2. In your fork, go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Actions` ‚Üí `General` ‚Üí Enable "Read and write permissions"
3. Create your own `COPILOT_TOKEN` secret (requires GitHub Copilot subscription)
4. Run the workflow: `gh workflow run copilot-qa.yml -f question="Your question here"`

Your fork will work independently with your own Copilot access and responses.

### For Repository Owners: Initial Setup

### 1. Configure Repository Settings

1. Go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Actions` ‚Üí `General`
2. Under **Workflow permissions**, select:
   - ‚úÖ **Read and write permissions**

> **Note**: The workflow commits to the `copilot-responses` branch, which is not protected, so PR creation permissions are not required.

### 2. Add Secrets (Repository Owner Only)

#### For Copilot Q&A (`COPILOT_TOKEN`)

**Important**: GitHub Copilot CLI requires a regular GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the `copilot` scope - it does NOT require a separate Copilot-specific token. The PAT allows the CLI to access GitHub Copilot on behalf of your account.

**Prerequisites:**
- Active GitHub Copilot subscription for your GitHub account
- Eligible plans: **Copilot Free**, **Copilot Pro**, **Copilot Pro+**, **Copilot Business**, or **Copilot Enterprise**
- For Free/Pro plans: [Sign up here](https://github.com/features/copilot)
- For organizations: Must be assigned Copilot access by your organization admin

**Setup steps:**

1. Create a [Personal Access Token (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with these scopes:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories) - *required for repository access*
   - `copilot` (GitHub Copilot) - **required to use Copilot API**

2. Add the token to repository secrets as `COPILOT_TOKEN`:
   ```
   Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret
   Name: COPILOT_TOKEN
   Value: <your-PAT-token>
   ```

#### For Copilot Coding Agent (`COPILOT_OAUTH_TOKEN`)

**Important**: GitHub Copilot Coding Agent requires an OAuth token for autonomous operation. This token allows the agent to create branches, commit code, and open pull requests.

**Prerequisites:**
- GitHub Copilot Business or Enterprise subscription
- Organization must have Copilot Agent features enabled

**Setup Options:**

##### Option 1: OAuth Application (Recommended)

**Best for:** Organizations with multiple repositories and users

1. Create an OAuth application in your GitHub organization:
   - Go to `Organization Settings` ‚Üí `Developer settings` ‚Üí `OAuth Apps` ‚Üí `New OAuth App`
   - Set the callback URL to your repository or organization
   - Note the Client ID and generate a Client Secret

2. Generate an OAuth token with appropriate scopes:
   - `repo` (Full control of repositories)
   - `pull_requests:write` (Create and manage pull requests)
   - `contents:write` (Create and modify repository contents)

3. Add the token to repository secrets as `COPILOT_OAUTH_TOKEN`:
   ```
   Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret
   Name: COPILOT_OAUTH_TOKEN
   Value: <your-oauth-token>
   ```

##### Option 2: Personal OAuth Token (Alternative)

**Use when:** Cannot create OAuth applications due to organization restrictions

**‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations compared to OAuth Apps:**
- **Security**: Tied to personal account, harder to rotate and manage
- **Permissions**: Uses your personal permissions, not application-specific
- **Auditability**: Actions appear under your name, not as application
- **Scalability**: Doesn't work well for team/organization workflows
- **Lifecycle**: Token becomes invalid if you leave organization or account is suspended
- **Rate limits**: Shares rate limits with your personal GitHub usage

**Setup steps:**

1. Create a [Personal Access Token (fine-grained)](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) with these permissions:
   - Repository access: Select specific repositories or organization
   - **Repository permissions:**
     - Contents: Read and write
     - Metadata: Read
     - Pull requests: Write
     - Issues: Write (optional, for linking)
   - **Account permissions:**
     - Git SSH keys: Write (if needed)

2. **Alternative:** Create a [Personal Access Token (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with these scopes:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)

3. Add the token to repository secrets as `COPILOT_OAUTH_TOKEN`:
   ```
   Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret
   Name: COPILOT_OAUTH_TOKEN
   Value: <your-personal-oauth-token>
   ```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes for Personal Tokens:**
- Token format should start with `github_pat_` (fine-grained) or `ghp_` (classic)
- Consider creating a dedicated service account for better separation
- Regularly rotate tokens for security
- Document token ownership and renewal process
- Monitor token usage in audit logs

> **Security Note**: Only repository owners/admins can add secrets. Contributors cannot override the configured tokens due to branch protection and secret permissions.

## üíª Usage

### üéØ Copilot Q&A

Ask questions and get answers saved to the `copilot-responses` branch:

```bash
gh workflow run copilot-qa.yml \
  -f question="How do I implement OAuth 2.0 authentication in Python?"
```

**What it does:**
1. Sends your question to GitHub Copilot CLI
2. Saves the response to `response.md` 
3. Archives a timestamped copy in `responses/` directory
4. Commits both files to the `copilot-responses` branch (not main)
5. Makes response available as downloadable artifact

**Response saved to `copilot-responses` branch:**
- `response.md` - Latest response (overwritten each time)
- `responses/response_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` - Archived copy with timestamp

**Example questions:**
```bash
# Ask about implementation
gh workflow run copilot-qa.yml \
  -f question="How do I implement rate limiting in Python using decorators?"

# Ask about best practices
gh workflow run copilot-qa.yml \
  -f question="What are the best practices for error handling in REST APIs?"

# Ask for code examples
gh workflow run copilot-qa.yml \
  -f question="Show me how to implement a simple caching system in Python"
```

### ü§ñ Copilot Coding Agent

Let GitHub Copilot Agent autonomously create code and pull requests:

```bash
gh workflow run copilot-agent-task.yml \
  -f task_description="Create a function to sort arrays" \
  -f base_branch="main"
```

**What it does:**
1. Runs GitHub Copilot Coding Agent with your task description
2. Agent autonomously analyzes the task and creates appropriate code
3. Agent creates a new branch and commits the code changes
4. Agent opens a pull request with the implementation
5. You receive notifications when the PR is ready for review
6. Agent can continue working on the task based on feedback

**Example tasks:**
```bash
# Create utility functions
gh workflow run copilot-agent-task.yml \
  -f task_description="Create a utility function for data validation with email and phone number checking"

# Implement features
gh workflow run copilot-agent-task.yml \
  -f task_description="Implement a REST API endpoint for user authentication with JWT tokens"

# Add tests
gh workflow run copilot-agent-task.yml \
  -f task_description="Add comprehensive unit tests for the existing calculator functions"

# Fix bugs
gh workflow run copilot-agent-task.yml \
  -f task_description="Fix the memory leak in the image processing module"
```

**Agent Workflow:**
1. üîç **Analysis**: Agent analyzes your task and repository structure
2. üèóÔ∏è **Planning**: Creates a plan for implementing the requested changes
3. üíª **Coding**: Writes code following best practices and repository patterns
4. üß™ **Testing**: May add tests if appropriate for the task
5. üìù **Documentation**: Updates documentation as needed
6. üîÑ **Review**: Opens PR for human review and feedback
7. üîÅ **Iteration**: Can continue working based on review feedback

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Q&A Workflow Issues

#### Workflow fails with "COPILOT_TOKEN not found"
- Ensure you've created a PAT with Copilot scope
- Add it as a secret named `COPILOT_TOKEN` in repository settings

#### Can't push to main branch
- This is expected - main branch is protected
- Responses are saved to `copilot-responses` branch automatically
- For other changes, create a feature branch and open a PR

#### Where are my Q&A responses?
- Check the `copilot-responses` branch
- Responses are not committed to `main` due to branch protection

### Coding Agent Issues

#### Workflow fails with "COPILOT_OAUTH_TOKEN not found"
- Ensure you've created an OAuth token with appropriate scopes
- Add it as a secret named `COPILOT_OAUTH_TOKEN` in repository settings
- OAuth token must start with `gho_` prefix

#### "gh agent-task command not available"
- GitHub CLI version must be 2.80.0 or later
- Update GitHub CLI: `gh extension upgrade cli` or reinstall

#### Agent doesn't create a PR
- Check if task description is specific enough
- Verify the base branch exists
- Check agent logs artifact for error details
- Some tasks may not require code changes

#### OAuth authentication fails
- Verify OAuth token has correct scopes (`repo`, `pull_requests:write`, `contents:write`)
- Check if token is expired or revoked
- Ensure organization has Copilot Agent features enabled
- **For Personal OAuth Tokens**: Verify token format (`github_pat_` or `ghp_` prefix)
- **For OAuth Apps**: Confirm app has necessary permissions and callback URL is correct

#### "Token does not appear to be an OAuth token"
- OAuth tokens should start with `gho_` (OAuth app) or `github_pat_`/`ghp_` (personal)
- Don't use Personal Access Tokens with `copilot` scope (those are for CLI, not Agent)
- Regenerate token if format is incorrect

### General Issues

#### GitHub CLI authentication problems
- Run `gh auth status` to check authentication
- Re-authenticate with `gh auth login`
- Verify token permissions in GitHub settings
