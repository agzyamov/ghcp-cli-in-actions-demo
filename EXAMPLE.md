# Example: Ask Copilot a Question

This example demonstrates how to use the Copilot Q&A workflow to get answers from GitHub Copilot CLI and commit them to your repository.

## How to Run

```bash
gh workflow run copilot-qa.yml \
  -f question="How do I implement rate limiting in Python using decorators?"
```

## What Happens

1. **Workflow Triggers**: The GitHub Action starts with your question
2. **Copilot CLI Executes**: Sends question to GitHub Copilot
3. **Response Generated**: Copilot provides a detailed answer
4. **Files Created**:
   - `response.md` - Latest answer (in root directory)
   - `responses/response_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` - Archived timestamped copy
5. **Committed to Repo**: Both files are automatically committed
6. **Artifact Available**: Response also available as downloadable artifact

## Example Questions

### Implementation Questions
```bash
gh workflow run copilot-qa.yml \
  -f question="How do I implement OAuth 2.0 authentication in Python?"
```

### Best Practices
```bash
gh workflow run copilot-qa.yml \
  -f question="What are the best practices for error handling in REST APIs?"
```

### Code Examples
```bash
gh workflow run copilot-qa.yml \
  -f question="Show me how to implement a simple caching system in Python"
```

### Architecture Advice
```bash
gh workflow run copilot-qa.yml \
  -f question="What's the best way to structure a microservices architecture with Python?"
```

## Expected Output

After running the workflow, you'll find:

### `response.md` (Root Directory)
```markdown
# Copilot Response
